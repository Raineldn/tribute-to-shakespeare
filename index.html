				<!-- Timeline of Life -->
				<h2 class="header">William Shakespeare was an English playwright and poet who is widely considered to be the greatest dramatist of all time. Also known as the "Bard of Avon," Shakespeare's plays and poems are known throughout the world, but his personal life is shrouded in mystery.</h2>

							<h1> 1564 </h1>
							<h2> BIRTH AND BAPTISM: <br> STRATFORD UPON AVON, ENGLAND </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and successful glover (glove-maker), and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son. </p>

							<h1> 1582 </h1>
							<h2> MARRIAGE TO ANNE HATHAWAY: <br> WORCESTER, CANTERBURY, ENGLAND </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway on November 28, 1582, in Worcester, in Canterbury Province. Hathaway was from Shottery, a small village a mile west of Stratford. William was 18 and Anne was 26, and, as it turns out, pregnant. Their first child, a daughter they named Susanna, was born on May 26, 1583. Two years later, on February 2, 1585, twins Hamnet and Judith were born. Hamnet later died of unknown causes at age 11. </p>

							<h1> 1590 </h1>
							<h2> FIRST PLAY IS WRITTEN: HENRY VI, PART ONE </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> Around this time, Shakespeare writes Henry VI, Part One—his very first play. Like all of Shakespeare's plays, the precise year of its authorship is now unclear. Also around the same time, Shakespeare leaves Stratford to begin work as a playwright and actor in London. </p>

						<div class="title">
							<h1> 1592 </h1>
							<h2> GREENE ATTACKS SHAKESPEARE </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> Playwright Robert Greene pens a scathing critique of Shakespeare, calling him an "upstart crow" who doesn't belong with Greene's university-educated dramatist crowd. Thanks to this diatribe, we now know that Shakespeare has become successful enough as a playwright by 1592 to make his peers jealous. </p>

						<div class="title">
							<h1> 1593 </h1>
							<h2> PLAGUE CLOSES THEATRES </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> London theaters are closed due to an outbreak of bubonic plague that eventually kills about five percent of the city's residents. Shakespeare uses the break to write poetry. </p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="column">
						<div class="title">
							<h1> 1594 </h1>
							<h2> THEATRES REOPEN </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> In the spring of 1594, the London theaters reopen to the public. Over the next five years Shakespeare's troupe, the Chamberlain's Men, becomes one of the most popular acting groups in London. They accept frequent invitations to perform in the royal court of Queen Elizabeth I. </p>

							<h2> SHAKESPEARE BUYS THE SECOND-LARGEST HOUSE IN STRATFORD </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> Wealthy thanks to his theater work and shrewd investments, Shakespeare buys New Place, the second-largest house in Stratford. </p>

							<h1> 1598 </h1>
							<h2> SHAKESPEARE IS HEAVILY PRAISED </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> Writer Francis Meres publishes a glowing review of Shakespeare's work. Thanks to Meres' review, we know that by this time Shakespeare has become a noted playwright with at least a dozen plays under his belt, including Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, Love's Labors Lost, Richard II and Titus Andronicus. </p>

							<h1> 1599 </h1>
							<h2> GLOBE THEATRE IS BUILT </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> The Chamberlain's Men build the Globe, a wooden theater in London. Many of Shakespeare's most famous plays are performed for the first time here, including a href="https://www.shmoop.com/hamlet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear. Plays Shakespeare is believed to have written in this amazingly productive year include Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, Julius Caesar, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. </p>

					<div class="column">
						<div class="title">
							<h1> 1601 </h1>
							<h2> HAMLET IS WRITTEN AFTER HIS FATHER'S DEATH </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> Shakespeare's father dies and his patron Earl Southampton is sentenced to death (later reprieved) for his role in the Essex rebellion. It is believed that his father's death motivates Shakespeare to write Hamlet around this time. Shakespeare's plays over the next few years take a dark, brooding tone. </p>

							<h1> 1613 </h1>
							<h2> FINAL PLAYS </h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p> Shakespeare composes his final plays— Henry VIII, Two Noble Kinsmen (possibly written in 1614), and the now-lost Cardenio—in collaboration with John Fletcher, replacement playwright for the King's Men. The Globe catches fire during a performance of Henry VIII and burns to the ground. </p>
